A Private link:https://registry.terraform.io/[Terraform Module Registry]
in the early stages of development.

== Requirements

* Node.js 8+
* HTTPS - Terraform module registry only support HTTPS.

== Usage
link:https://github.com/outsideris/citizen//releases/latest[Download the latest release!]

=== `citizen server`
To launch the registry server
[source, sh]
....
$ ./citizen server
....

It will be launched at link:http://localhost:3000[http://localhost:3000]. You can check it at link:http://localhost:3000/health[http://localhost:3000/health].

Because link:https://www.terraform.io/[Terraform CLI] works with only HTTPS server, you should set up HTTPS in front of the registry server.

If you want to test it at local, you need a tool which provides HTTPS like link:https://ngrok.com/[ngrok].

Environment variables:

* `CITIZEN_DATA_PATH`: A directory to save database file. The default is `data` directory in a current working directory (absolute/relative path can be used).
* `CITIZEN_STORAGE` : Storage type to store module files. You can use `file` or `s3` type.
* `CITIZEN_STORAGE_PATH`: A directory to save module files only if `CITIZEN_STORAGE` is `file` (absolute/relative path can be used).
* `CITIZEN_AWS_S3_BUCKET``: A S3 bucket to save module files only if `CITIZEN_STORAGE` is `s3`.
* `CITIZEN_HOSTNAME``: Hostname where citizen can be found. By default http://localhost is used, bear in mind that terraform client needs https and this is used as a value for X-Terraform-Get.
* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Your AWS access key only if `CITIZEN_STORAGE` is `s3`.
* `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your AWS secret access key only if `CITIZEN_STORAGE` is `s3`.

=== `citizen publish`
Since link:https://registry.terraform.io/[official Terraform Module Registry] is integrated with GitHub, users can publish terraform modules if they just push it on GitHub.

Citizen provides a special command to publish a module onto citizen registry server instead integrating GitHub.

In a module directory, you can publish your terraform module via a command below:
[source, sh]
....
$ ./citizen publish <namespace> <name> <provider> <version>
....

You should set `CITIZEN_ADDR` as citizen registry server address which you will publish your modules to. e.g. `https://registry.example.com`.

=== Examples
If you have ALB module in `./alb` directory and your registry server is launched at `https://registry.example.com`, you run below command in `./alb` directory to publish ALB module.
[source, sh]
....
$ CITIZEN_ADDR=https://registry.example.com \
  citizen publish dev-team alb aws 0.1.0
....

Then, you can define it in your terraform file like this:
....
module "alb" {
  source = "registry.example.com/dev-team/alb/aws"
  version = "0.1.0"
}
....

== Docker
You can use docker to launch the registry server.
The docker image is in link:https://hub.docker.com/r/outsideris/citizen/[outsideris/citizen].

[source, sh]
....
$ docker run -d -p "3000:3000" outsideris/citizen:latest
....

== Development
Set environment variables, see above.

[source, sh]
....
$ ./bin/citizen server
$ ./bin/citizen publish
....

=== Test
[source, sh]
....
$ npm test
....

=== Build distributions

[source, sh]
....
$ npm run build
....

Under ``dist/``,
citizen binaries for linux, darwin and windows made.
